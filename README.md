CPTR 319 WPF Demo project for 2021

This project uses C# .NET Core 3.1 and SQLite with both EntityFramework and ADO style database connections. 

 * All Entity Framework and SQLite .db files are stored in the Database folder.
 * All repository files and Data Transfer Objects (DTO objects) are stored in the Repository folder
 * ViewModels are in the ViewModels folder
 * Views are in the project root folder (I know I should have moved them)
